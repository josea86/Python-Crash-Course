# Python Crash Course – Exercises & Learning Journey

This repository contains the exercises, examples, and small projects I'm building while working through the book **"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes**.

## 📚 Purpose of this Repository

I'm currently learning Python from a practical, hands-on perspective. This repo serves as a personal log of my progress, and a way to share what I'm learning with others.

You'll find:

- Chapter-by-chapter exercises from the book
- Small custom scripts inspired by the topics covered
- Practice code that reflects how I'm improving over time

If you're also learning Python, you might find it helpful to see how someone else approaches the same challenges.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
