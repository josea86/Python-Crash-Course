# This program stores a list of major rivers and the countries they run through in a dictionary.
# It then iterates through the dictionary to print information about each river and its country.
# Create a dictionary named 'rivers_country'.
# This dictionary maps the name of a river (string) as the key to the country (string)
# it runs through as the value.

                }

# Use a 'for' loop to iterate through each key-value pair in the 'rivers_country' dictionary.
# The .items() method returns a view of the dictionary's key-value pairs as a list of 2-element tuples.
# 'river' will hold the key (the river's name), and 'country' will hold the value (the country's name)
# in each iteration.
