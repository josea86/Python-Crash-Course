# This program stores a list of people and their multiple favorite numbers in a nested dictionary.
# It then iterates through this structure to print out each person's name and their list of favorite numbers.

# Create a dictionary named 'favorite_numbers'.
# This dictionary uses people's names (strings) as keys.
# The value associated with each person's name is another dictionary.
# This inner dictionary stores multiple favorite numbers, with keys like 'number_1', 'number_2', etc.,
# and their corresponding number values (stored as strings).
# We could optimized this program if we use a list inside the favorite_numbers dictionary
# instead of nested dictionaries. But the purpouse of this exercise is using nesting dictionaries.
