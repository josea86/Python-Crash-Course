# This program creates a simple glossary of Python terms using a dictionary.
# It then prints each term and its refined definition.

# Create a dictionary named 'glossary_words'.
# This dictionary stores common Python keywords/methods as keys and their
# more precise explanations as values.

# We access each definition by using its corresponding key from the 'glossary_words' dictionary.
# '\n' is used to create a new line, formatting the output for better readability.
